# LATTE: Visual Smart Contract Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sean2108/LATTE.svg?token=FcLFkh211qmFY1Deqxzn&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Sean2108/LATTE)

LATTE is a graphical user interface tool that makes it easy for both developers and non-developers to create and deploy smart contracts. It uses a drag and drop interface to simplify the task of creating smart contracts, and it helps users to compile and deploy smart contracts onto the blockchain.

Uses electron, react, solc and web3. Material-UI is used to style the application.
